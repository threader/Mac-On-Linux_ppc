To build the MOL adapted MacOS X boot loader, do
the following:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

This will produce a 'bootx' file. The binary  is intended
to be run within MOL (it will sefault if it is invoked
from the command line).

MOL normally looks for this binary in 

	/usr/share/mol/0.9.72/bin/bootx

although this can be changed through the use of the

	bootx_image:	path_to_bootx_binary

config setting.
